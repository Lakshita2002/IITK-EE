# ESO203A - Introduction to Electrical Engineering

I did this course under <a href="https://iitk.ac.in/new/ankush-sharma"><i><b>Prof. Ankush Sharma</b></i></a>. This course is a DC for all batti (obvious) and mech (no idea why :shrugging:) students. This objective of this course is to introduce us to power systems and electrical engineering behind power transmission. The takeaway for mech branch might be the mechanical aspect of the transformers, motors, generators, etc. Well, god knows the purpose :joy:

### Instructor
Disclaimer: I will try my best to say everything with utmost respect, considering he is a professor here.<br>
Prof. Ankush Sharma is not the kind of professor you would wish for. He is the total opposite of what you wish for in a professor. My experience in this course was one of the worst and that is true for ALL batti and mech Y19 UGs (I dare you to go and ask anybody from this group, beware, doing so might invite some strong _gaaliyan_). I agree that online teaching is not easy even for the professors and I fully support the statement, but that does not give them the right to bring down the quality of teaching to a bare minimum. There were numerous instances were we, as a batch, suggested him helpful ideas, which had been proven effective in solving the corresponding issues in other courses. But he just made this course experience as miserable as he could. Students are usually not happy with professors due to stuff like grading, etc and that is perfectly normal, but here everybody started questioning the kind of teaching that was been delivered by him. It was just a terrible experience. And in the end, after someone tried to report the situation to the DUGC, he tried to pin the blame to us, in the most sarcastic way he could. You can see the report and his reply <a href="mail.pdf">here</a>.

### Tutors & Tutorials
There were no tutorial sheets or anything of that sort. Mini-quizzes were held in the first 10 mins of the tutorials. It was followed by a discussion of the questions from the miniquiz. My tutor was <a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in/new/parthasarathi-sensarma"><i>Prof. Parthsarthi Sensarma</i></a> and though I stopped attending the tutorials (as there was no point), his explainations were quite clear and helpful. So, if you get him as a professor in some course, I guess it would be fun.

Reference books mentioned by the instructor included :-

### Pattern of Exam
- :page_facing_up: 10+ objective mini-quizzes were conducted and best 10 of them were considered for a total of 20% weightage in the course. The quizzes were held during the first 10-15 mins of the tutorials each week. They consisted of 1-2 questions which were to be solved within 10 mins.
- :page_facing_up: 2 graded assignments were given to solve (the questions in the second assignment were directly copied from the third book above). They carried a total of 10% weightage of the course.
- :books: The usual (yet unusual) Midsem and Endsem with 30% and 40% weightage respectively.

### Lectures & Course Content 
All of his lecture slides can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e3h6bViGg5zXY-eHbbdKR17th8gJZWIp?usp=sharing">here</a>.
The content of this course is a bit comprehensive, but our instructor spent half of the semester teaching us KVL, KCL, Nodal & Mesh analysis, Two port networks, etc etc, i.e. everything that was either taught in class 12 or ESC201A. The second half of the semester becomes very difficult to handle. Transformers, Motors and Generators (both DC and AC) are introduced with a tonne of concepts and calculations. I would advice to follow the book more than his lectures as his lectures were not helpful. He just plainly repeated every word written in his slide and his slides were not very well written. Referring to books, mentioned above, will prove very useful so better depend on them, rather than his lectures. Use YouTube to find video explaining the concepts, don't wait for him to explain it to you.

### Grading
His grading scheme was liked by no one. During our endsems, India was dealing with the peak of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic and so were a lot of students and their family members. So, like everyone, we were requesting him for relaxation of some sort in the endsem. In many courses, the professors decided to prorate the endsems with the option to give the endsems to increase marks. But, our instructor decided to remove the assignments as <i>"we had anyways copied them with each other"</i> and increased the weightage of the endsem to 50% (maybe the definition of "relaxation" in his dictionary is different). The endsem consisted of 12 numerical-type objective questions with 4 marks alloted to each of them. And in the end, the course max was 61.5, A was given above 51, B was gievn above 41, and so on (the numbers are approximate).

Please pay proper attention to this course as it will become very difficult if you don't. And refer the books beforehand, rather than devoting time for learning KVL, KCL, etc all over again.
