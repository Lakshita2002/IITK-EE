# IITK-EE

### Hi Visitor !!
My name is <i><b>Harsh Kumar</b></i>. I am a Y19 undergraduate student at IIT Kanpur. I have tried my best to compile any and all resources and study material related to batti (IITK lingo for Electrical Engg. branch) DCs and DEs at IITK that I could get. 

Note:- At the moment, I am still building this repo, so some of this might sound weird but it is meant for the time when the repo has a tonne of useful materials

- Mine was one of the those batches who were unlucky enough to have experienced the trauma of 2* consecutive online semesters. 
- Yet, the only positive aspect of that period was that, all resources were given to us as a soft copy, which made it easy to organise them at places like here.
- As I progress through my semesters, I would be putting all my study materials here. 
<!-- - And, I will also try to fetch materials for other EE courses from my friends who would be taking them. -->
- And to make it a bit different from all other resource compilation, I would be putting up some advices, feedbacks and my experiences in those courses. 
<!-- - I will also try to make such compilation for the courses that my friends would be taking too. -->


Here's what I have - 

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Semester</th>
		<th colspan="7">Courses</th>

	<tr>

	</tr>

That's enough to start with.
