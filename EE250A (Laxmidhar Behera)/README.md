# EE250A - Control Systems Analysis

I did this course under <a href="https://iitk.ac.in/new/laxmidhar-behera"><i><b>Prof. Laxmidhar Behera</b></i></a>. This course is a DC and it introduces you to a specific field of core electrical engineering, namely control systems, which have profound usgae in almost all controlled machinery like robotics. This course will teach you that 5+5 can make 10 but in the end it will depend on you if you want to take 3+7 to make 10 or 2+3+5 to make 10, i.e., certain conventional design methods will be taught but in the end we just want to meet the requirements of our system and design it accordingly.

### Instructor
Putting it carefully :sweat:, Prof. Laxmidhar Behera is a different kind of a professor. He was teaching a UG batch after about 5-7 years (not sure about this but this is what everyone was saying so I thought it must be true). Prof Behera is usually pretty occupied in the high level projects he is involved in. He is also a very religious man and he solely conducts sessions to spread the knowledge of <i>The Gita</i>. He can be disturbing at times. I, personally, would not wish to do a course under him ever. When it comes to teaching, he never explained a concept's origin/derivation to bring clarity in it, instead he straightaway jumped to exmaples to show how they work. Several times, I found that the derivation of certain formulae and origin of certain concepts, pretty helpful in bringing clarity that the instructor could not bring.

### Tutors & Tutorials
My tutor was <a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in/new/twinkle-tripathy"><i>Asst. Prof. Twinkle Tripathy</i></a>. The problem was that the tutorials sheets were given a night before the tutorials. The instructor expected us to solve it in the tutorial while the tutopr expected us to solve it beforehand. The tutorial sheets were not very helpful. Honestly, just knowing the concepts was enough.

### Books
Reference books mentioned by the instructors included <i>Control System: Principle and Design</i> by Madan Gopal. Although, for me, the lecture notes by the instructor were more than sufficient (but at some places, you need to refer to other sources for clarity as some parts in the notes seem difficult to understand). I found the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq0imsn84ShAe9PBOFnoIrg">Control System lectures</a> by <i>Brian Douglas</i>, pretty useful as a backup source of clarity.

### Pattern of Exam
- :page_facing_up: 4 objective quizzes were conducted and best 3 of them were considered for 15%. The quizzes were fast paced, where each question had a miniscule time limit, ranging from 1-4 mins each. This made the quizzes, a pain in our a\*s.
- :page_facing_up: 2 MATLAB tests were scheduled (though only one could take place) for 15% of the total weightage. There were simple design questions and application of other numerical methods, to be scripted as a MATLAB code.
- :books: The usual Midsem and Endsem with 25% and 45% weightage respectively.

### Lectures & Course Content 
I found the content to be a way less as compared to other courses and the amount of content that is usually covered in a semester. This course just has design concepts for control systems. For the calculations' aspect, Laplace transform, taught in EE200, is the only mathematical tool used for almost all tasks. A few numerical methods for solving ODEs are taught but those are insignificant when compared to the entire course. You can literally, just give a couple of hours on a single day per week, and the syllabus can be easily managed (but that depends on your ability and time you require, don't follow my word blindly :hand_over_face:). Lectures by Madan Gopal on YouTube portal of NPTEL can also be helpful (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA74601484F6994D8">click here</a>). 

### Grading
No one has any idea as to what kind of grading scheme was followed by the instructor. The class average was around 55% with a standard deviation of around 10. As for grading, it is very easy to score good marks in the subjective papers because the content is simpler relative to the content being covered in other courses (this might not be true for everyone, so I can't generalise it).

Although the content is simpler and less than other courses, do not procastinate. A little regularity can help you in the long run. And, since scoring is easy, everyone will be scoring good, so you cannot afford to be lazy with this course.
