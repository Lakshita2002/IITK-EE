# EE210A - Microelectronics I

I did this course under <a href="https://iitk.ac.in/new/aloke-dutta"><i><b>Prof. Aloke Dutta</b></i></a>. This course is a DC and takes you ahead in the content covered breifly in the previous course, i.e. ESC201A. This course is the first course which will give you the feeling of what a specialisation in core electrical might look like. And many of you will surely find microelectronics interesting and this course might surely encourage you to pursue it further by taking advanced courses in this domain.

### Instructor
Prof. Aloke Dutta is a very enthusiastic instructor who will be a friend to you, but in the meanwhile, he is very strict :monocle_face: about ideals and principles. I found his explainations to be very precise and clear. He was always very cheerful in the discussion hours. And he specifically mentioned it several times that he is a "blackboard teacher" and hence he is finding it difficult to deliver his best. I guess one would enjoy a lot with him in an offline semester.

### Tutors & Tutorials
My tutor was <a href="https://iitk.ac.in/new/shafi-qureshi"><i>Prof. Shafi Qureshi</i></a>. We had regular tutorials where solution to the assignments were discussed. The assignments were a bit on the lengthy side but they did test your concept clarity. The assignments were pretty useful.

### Books
Prof. Aloke Dutta followed his own book <a href="https://india.oup.com/product/semiconductor-devices-and-circuits-9780195676877"> :book: Semiconductor Devices</a>. It is not available for free but can be accessed via app.kortext.com where you have to enter the institution name to lead you to the institution specific portal and then create an account. But his slides were more than enough for understanding the concepts. For questions to practice, one can always refer this book AFTER doing the assignments.

### Pattern of Exam
- :page_facing_up: Mini-quizzes were conducted every week during the first 15 mins of the discussion hour. A single subjective question was asked based on the material covered in the previous week and 10 mins were given to solve it. Mini-quizzes were meant to be easy and scoring, yet it wasn't for us :sweat_smile:. There were a total of 10 mini-quizzes and it carried a total of 25% weightage.
- :book: 2 Major quizzes were conducted like usual, but it also consisted of a single subjective question and we were given 30 mins to solve it. A total of 15% weightage was given to them.
- :books: The usual Midsem and Endsem with 25% and 35% weightage respectively (which was later changed for us due to some reason :neutral_face:)

### Lectures & Course Content 
This course is very conceptual but at the same time, it includes a tonne of maths. You cannot afford to be slow in doing calculations involving decimals and try to be fast on calculations on a calculator :abacus:. The course content includes detailed discussion on diodes, BJTs and MOSFETs in the beginning along with their biasing. Then the big guns, like amplifiers and output stages are presented to you. Amplifiers is the most crucial topic so make sure that there are no doubts remaining in that section. All types of biasing, current mirrors, amplifiers, output stages, etc will be taught as modules. Because in the end, our goal is to analyse an opamp, which is a 20+ transistor network. That sounds scary :flushed: but it is very easy. Overall, you should not lose focus at any point in this course or else it can be disasterous :ghost:. 

### Grading
The instrutor had declared a semi absolute grading scheme. The cutoffs were initially placed at 90+ for A\*, 75+ for A, 60-75 for B, 45-60 for C, 30-45 for D, 15-30 for E, and less than 15 for F. But the instructor also made it clear that the cutoffs might go down for the benefit of the class if the class performace demands it so. In the end the cutoffs were lowered by about 5%. So, A was given for 70+, B was given for 55-70, C was gievn for 40-55 and D was gievn for 25-40 while the others were deregistered (I am not very sure about the cutoffs but this, most probably, was the scenario). The marks distribution and the statistics were not declared. As I have already mentioned, the exams included a tonne of maths and the questions were usually like a case study, hence a single mistake in the calculation could cause a domino effect, and the marks obtained for the part will turn to dust. So pay proper attention to your calculations.

When all the instructors were posting recorded lectures or taking live lectures, Prof. Aloke decided to send slides and voice clipings containing the explaination (on the pretext of students not having proper internet connection :upside_down_face:). So if he had sent video lectures, it would have been great, but I did not face much problem. But what troubled me the most was that we were required to keep our videos ON during all the exams (from 15 min mini-quizzes to 3 hour endsem) and our papers won't be graded if that instruction was not followed (A slight hint of hypocrisy is visible :shushing_face:). Well, nobody is perfect :sunglasses:.
