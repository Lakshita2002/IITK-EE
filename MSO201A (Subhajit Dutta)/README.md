# MSO201A - Probability and Statistics

I did this course under <a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in/new/subhajit-dutta"><i><b>Prof. Subhajit Dutta</b></i></a>. This course is a DC for all batti and MTH students. This is a very nice and imprtant course w.r.t. to internships and placements in the future. This course lays the foundation to the concepts of proabbility and statistical analysis that will be required in the future.

### Instructor
Prof. Subhajit Dutta was a very nice instructor overall. His notes were very useful and he was one of the calmest professors that I have seen. His explainations were very clear and to the point. Surprisingly, we never saw his face throughout the semester :laughing:. 

### Tutors & Tutorials
Tutorial assignments were given beforehand to solve and then they were discussed in the tutorials. My tutor was <a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in/new/r-k-bansal"><i>Prof. R K Bansal</i></a>. His explainations were to the point too. The questions in the tutorials sheets were more formulae based instead of real life scenarios and examples. So for such questions, refer the books and other sources.

### Books
Reference books mentioned by the instructors included

### Pattern of Exam
- :page_facing_up: 5 objective quizzes were conducted for a total of 50% weightage in the course. The questions asked in the quizzes never reflected the kind of questions asked in the tutorials sheets. So it was difficult for us to prepare/practice such kind of questions. On top of that the quizzes were of 10 marks each, therefore each mark was 1% of the course. The quiz averages were 6.33, 3, 3, 5, 2.3 for the respective quizzes (each out of 10 marks each).
- :books: The usual Midsem and Endsem with 20% and 30% weightage respectively. They were also of the same marks as their weightage so each mark carried 1%. Midsem average was 4.61/20 and that of the endsem was 7.75/30.

### Lectures & Course Content 
The course content is such that it demands regularity. Procastinating in this course can be disastrous (learned that the hard way :disappointed_relieved:). The content is not very hard but not too easy too. Practicing questions will help a lot. Two-thirds of the course is mainly focused on different probability distributions while the last one-third of the course focuses on statistical analysis using some basic procedures. The instructor had posted 'unlisted' videos on YouTube. You can access all the links <a href="https://github.com/phoenix-23/IITK-EE/blob/master/MSO201A%20(Subhajit%20Dutta)/Notes/lectures.md">here</a> (though I am not sure til when these will remain accessible).

### Grading
A relative grading scheme was followed by the instructor. The averages in the quizzes and midsem & endsems hint that something was wrong with the course (and I can guarantee that cheating happened to a maximum). The problem lied with the pattern of the examination. The quizzes were very tough as the questions were to be solved in 3 mins each which put a lot of pressure. It became a marathon and instead of judging our understanding, our speed was being tested. And the irony is that the instructor resorted to such pattern to curb cheating, but this forced even the honest students to cheat to get atleast some marks in the exams. The objective nature of the quizzes implied binary marking, so 50% of the course consisted of binary marks. And by the time midsem/endsem came, all students were so discouraged that even the subjective papers (with partial marking) could not help them get marks. The course average was around 32 with a standard deviation of around 10. So A was given at around 42.

Regularity and a little bit of practice is the key to performing well in this course.
